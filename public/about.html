<h3>The CMa Virtual Machine Implementation</h3> 

<p>
I created this 100% client side JavaScript implementation of the CMa Virtual Machine as described in the
text <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642149085">Compiler Design: Virtual Machines</a> by Reinhard Wilhelm 
and Helmut Seidl in preparation for a course I was about to take at 
<a href="http://www.aspen.edu/degrees/doctoral-degree/doctorate-of-science-in-computer-science/classes">Aspen University DCS904</a>.  
The text arrived early and the class wasn't to start for a couple of weeks so I decided to have some fun and 
implement the C virtual machine described in chapter 2 of the text as both 
a means of killing time and providing some insights into the material in the text.</p>
<p>
Well, I certainly hit the mark on the first one. On the second goal, however I think I have found a number 
of discrepancies in the text and there were a lot omissions of detail that I had to guess at.  I tried to fill
in those gaps with this resource I found on the net; 
<a href="http://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de/teaching/cc07/project/cma.pdf" target="_blank">cma.pdf</a> but it too seemed 
to be little out of synch with the text.
</p>
<p>
So all I can say is that <b>this implementation (still incomplete) may not match exactly the machine as described in 
the text</b> or the PDF.  But at least it works and so far seems reasonable consistent.
