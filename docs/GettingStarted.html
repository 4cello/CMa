				<p/>
				<p>
				This 100% client side Javascript application is an implementation of the CMa virtual machine as defined by
				the text <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642149085">Compiler Design: Virtual Machines</a> by 
				Reinhard Wilhelm and Helmut Seidl.  I did the best I could, given the information in the text, so there is
				no guarantee that it is completely correct. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The main goal of this effort was to produce a tool that a student could use to try out some of the ideas, 
				concepts and most importantly the code described in this text.  It is by no means an efficient implementation 
				as I favored code simplicity and readability over efficiency.  The user interface was designed (or should I 
				say evolved) to help explain what is happening at each step and to provide tools to make it easy to try out
				different options.
				</p>

				<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
				<p>
				The fastest way to start using this virtual machine is to try it out with one of the sample programs. Using
				the Load Sample button at the top right of the main page, select the Simple example.  This example is not a 
				full C program interpreted for the CMa machine, but rather some quick instructions, including a predefined 
				value set in memory. 
				</p>

				<p>
				If your screen looks like that in Figure 1. you are almost ready to step through the code. Before you begin 
				you may want to scroll the Stack View such that the bottom of the table is in view (see Figure).  For the 
				simple program you will see the memory location 5 has the value 10, with a note 'x'.
				</p>
				<p>
				Press the Next button in the control panel to execute the first instruction. You'll notice a few changes 
				in the state of the UI. Each time you press the Next button	the program counter register (PC) will increment 
				by one.  Then the instruction will be executed. This first instruction, <code>loadc 1</code> will put the 
				constant 1 on top of the stack. You'll also notice that the values on the stack are shaded.  This means that
				the stack pointer (SP) has been changed to 0, and all values in main memory below the stack pointer are
				shaded to indicate that they are active.  
				</p>
				<figure class="figure">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/step1.png" style="max-height:400px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">State of machine after execution of first instruction <code>loadc 1</code></figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>
				The program counter now points to the next instruction. Press the Next button again to load the constant 2 
				on top of the stack.  Again the program counter and stack pointer will increment. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Continue pressing the Next button watching the stack and registers as they change.  When you execute the last
				instruction; <code>halt</code> the machine will be halted, no further execution can take place. A message is 
				written in the output. Notice that the last instruction is also identified by the label 'end', which can be 
				referenced by name in CMa programs.
				</p>
				<p>
				That's it. That's all she does.  Well, the simple program that is.  You can press the Reset button to execute the 
				program again, or perhaps try a different sample program.   If you want to look a the full, commented source 
				for the program loaded press the Source button.  It will open up another tab in the browser and display the program 
				in plain text form with any comments (text after semicolons in any line).
				</p>
				
				<h2 id="screen">The Screen</h2>
				<p>
				At the very top of the screen are two configuration options to set the VM main memory size, 
				and to adjust the viewable size of the Program Store, Stack and Heap Views.  We'll examine these 
				later.  The upper right hand corner has a button to load the sample code, hopefully you've already 
				used this to load the simple program.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<p>The rest of the page is divided up into panels.</p>
				
				<h3 id="pc">Program Store (C)</h3>
				<p>
				The program store is a separate set of memory (distinct from main memory) where the program instructions
				are stored and walked through.  The Program Counter register (PC) points to the next instruction in the 
				program store, which is adorned with a right chevron on the left of the table.
				</p>
				
				<h3 id="sv">Stack View</h3>
				<p>
				The stack view is one of two views into main memory (the other is the <a href="#hv">heap view</a>). It 
				appears next to the program store.  The highest memory locations appear first in this view, so typically
				it makes sense to scroll down to the bottom of the view to see the newest activity.  The stack view and the 
				heap view show the same main memory, however the rules for shading occupied locations are different.  In the
				stack view everything at the stack pointer and below are shaded a light blue.  Everything at or below the
				Extreme Pointer and up to the location pointed to by the stack pointer is shaded a light green.  
				</p>
				<figure class="figure">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/StackBelowEP.png" style="max-height:300px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Stack with space below EP.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>
				If for some reason an item is placed on the stack above the Extreme Pointer the memory location will be shaded
				red.
				</p>
				<figure class="figure">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/StackAboveEP.png" style="max-height:300px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Stack with space allocated above the EP.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<h3 id="hv">Heap View</h3>				
				<p>
				The heap view is one of two views into main memory (the other is the <a href="#sv">stack view</a>). Typically 
				this view begins at the top most memory location and you can scroll down to view the lower memory locations.
				The shading in this view is a light yellow for all memory locations above the value of the heap pointer (HP).
				</p>
				<figure class="figure">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/MemoryAllocated.png" style="max-height:250px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Memory Allocated</figcaption>
				</figure>
								
				<h3 id="reg">Registers</h3>
				<p>
				The registers panel shows the five built in registers of the virtual machine; the program counter (PC),
				frame pointer (FP), stack pointer (SP), extreme pointer (EP), and heap pointer (HP).  All five of which
				can be manually changed by clicking on the register name and entering in the new value with the dialog.
				</p>
				<figure class="figure">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/Registers.png" style="max-height:150px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">CMa Registers</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
				If the virtual machine throws an error while processing an instruction then it will appear as a red 
				panel within the Registers panel.
				</p>
				
				<h3 id="reg">Controls</h3>
				<p>
				The Controls panel includes all the commands you would use to interact with the virtual machine.  The 
				<b>Next</b> button will step past the next instruction (pointed to by the program counter). The <b>Run to Brkpt</b>
				button will execute all the statements in the program up to any marked with a breakpoint.  If no halt is 
				at the end of the program an error will be reported (in the area just under the Registers).  The <b>Run</b> command
				will run the program until it reaches a <code>halt</code> command or an error is thrown during the execution 
				of an instruction.  The <b>Restart</b> command will initialize the registers, and clear main memory, readying the 
				machine for another run of the program.  The <b>Edit</b> command will open up a modal dialog with a simple program
				editor and the current program in the edit area.  You can edit the program and update the machine for another 
				execution run (see <a href="EditingPrograms.html">Editing Programs</a>).  The <b>Source</b> command will open another
				browser tab and display the current program in plain text with any comments.
				</p>
				
				<h2 id="help">Instruction Help</h2>
				<p>
				If you want to know what a specific instruction does in your program, or rather be reminded of what it exactly does
				you can click on it in the Program Store panel.  A modal dialog will appear with the instruction and its semantics (as 
				defined by the text).
				</p>

					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/InstructionHelpPopup.png" style="max-height:200px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Instruction Documentation</figcaption>
				</figure>				
				
				<p>
				If you click on the <b>impl</b> link at the bottom of the dialog, another dialog will appear with the actual JavaScript 
				implementation of the instruction in it.
				</p>
				<figure class="figure">
					<img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/InstructionImplementation.png" style="max-height:150px"></img>
					<figcaption class="figure-caption">Instruction JavaScript Implementation</figcaption>
				</figure>	
				
				<p>
				If you are interested in all the instructions currently available on the machine you can click on the 
				<a href="../instructions.html" target="_blank">Instruction Set</a> link at the top left of the main page.  This will 
				open up another tab in the browser and display the list of all the instructions (in alphabetical order).  Clicking on 
				any of these instructions will expose the full description and JavaScript implementation.
